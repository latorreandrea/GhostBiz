Base Functionality Test

File created to test the library's efficiency step by step, 
in order to understand how to use it in the most effective way.

This test follows the official OSMnx examples from:
https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/main/notebooks/16-download-osm-geospatial-features.ipynb

The goal is to progressively test each OSMnx feature to identify 
the optimal approach for extracting business data from Copenhagen.
